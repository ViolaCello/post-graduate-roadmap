# Post-Work Roadmap

## Introduction

Consistency yields results.  As you embark on a job search, establishing a
routine that works for you is one of the best things you can do.  The structure
and accountability in your Flatiron program allowed for a significant amount of
learning in a condensed period of time. Now as an alumni, it is up to you to
establish this structure for yourself.

Striking a balance between your personal life and continuing to code while
investing in your job search is a challenge unique (and real!) to each of us.
This lesson includes suggestions for how you might structure your time - both
week-to-week and over the next few months in order to optimize your continued
learning during your job search.

## Laying Out the Work Ahead

In working with Flatiron’s Career Services team, let’s take a moment to account
for the activities you’ll be responsible for during your job search. The Career
Services Commitment (or CSC for short) outlines the specific requirements you’ll
need to meet in order to remain eligible for Flatiron's Money-Back Guarantee,
and was designed to set you up for success in your job search.  The Weekly Job
Search Activity lesson within the Career Prep Track goes into greater detail on
each requirement and also includes lots of useful advice. We recommend reading
through that lesson now before continuing.  If you have any questions about
this, you can ask your Career Coach.

To summarize, the Career Services Commitment requires you to complete the
following minimum activities each week throughout your job search:

* Make contact with at least eight (8) individuals, verified by first, last name
  and title, at prospective employers within your field of study
* Post at least one (1) written or video blog post
* Post at least 5 GitHub contributions per week to your public GitHub profile

In addition to these, you will likely have other tasks in mind based on your
personal interests and career goals. At the moment, this list might include some
or all of the following:

* Polish up and deploy your portfolio projects
* Build a personal website
* Practice code interview challenges
* Practice general interview questions
* Review programming topics you want to be more comfortable with (and learn new ones)
* Self-care!

Take a few minutes now to brainstorm and write out the tasks you would like to
accomplish to help you put your best foot forward. Some of these will remain on
your list throughout your job search (learning new programming topics), while
others might be short-term tasks (i.e. you only need to build your personal
website once). This list is something you can share with your Career Coach to
help you prioritize and find ways to optimize your efforts while continuing to
consistently accomplish the weekly CSC requirements.

## Establishing Your Routine

With your list of tasks, you can now plan a routine for yourself. Some students
find it helpful to use a Google calendar to do this - you can block out time,
configure reminders, and set up recurring weekly events to help stay on track.

Map out a routine that works best for you. We highly recommend front-loading
priority tasks and starting the week off strong, especially if you know that you
are prone to procrastination.

Here is an example of what this weekly calendar might look like:

| Monday        | Tuesday           | Wednesday  | Thursday | Friday |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Identify a specific new topic to learn about | | | | |
| Build a small app or add a feature to a project | | | |
| | | Write a blog post about the project to crystalize your learning and share it with others | | |
| | Finish app or feature | Share a link to your latest post with your prospective employers | Finish contacting all 8 prospective employers | |

Find a schedule that is realistic for you and your personal life, but do your
best to stick with it.

## Be strategic in how you tackle your job search tasks

Our most successful job seekers often find ways to combine the weekly CSC
requirements in a way that supports their ongoing learning.  

The calendar above shows how you might anchor your week around a new technical
skill to drive the completion of your CSC activities. After identifying a
specific topic to learn about:

* Build a small app or add a feature to an existing project based on what you’ve
  learned, fulfilling your git commit requirements.
* Write it all up to crystalize your learning and be able to share it with
  others, fulfilling your blog post requirement (Some students really like the
  tutorial format for blog posts).
* Share a link to your latest post in your prospective employer outreaches,
  fulfilling your requirements for contacting employers.

In another example, one alumn decided to ship his portfolio site in Week 1 of
his job search and then commit to adding one new feature each week, blogging
about what he had learned following.  This meant his site was continuously
improving as he was.

What if you have an upcoming second or third round interview scheduled?  How
might you focus on building something related to this company in order to
demonstrate your interest - and importantly your effort? Can you preemptively
write a blog post about a topic you want to highlight to the employer?  We call
these value-added projects, and they have helped hundreds of graduates seal the
deal.  In one particular case, the project was sent around to the whole company
and they were so impressed by the thoughtfulness and creativity that they made
an offer on the spot.

Plan your weeks in such a way that you get to learn something new, practice it,
write about it, and share it with others as you continue to expand your network.

## Mapping Out the Road Ahead

A job search can take time, and while it’s hard to know exactly how much time -
spending a few minutes to write down a roadmap for yourself can help you
prioritize based on your goals. It can also help prevent anxiety caused by
trying to keep tabs on everything entirely in your head, and can help you anchor
to a plan.

When writing out a roadmap for months ahead (we recommend planning for 6
months), don't think about the time as one large chunk of time. Instead, think
about the time in milestones - where would you like to be in one month? What is
realistically achievable in that time?

To help you get started, below are some suggested milestones based on the Career
Services Commitment and some of the content in this track. Use this as a
starting point and adjust it to fit your own plans and goals.

## First Month

At the end of your first month, you should aim to have the following completed:

* Four post-graduation blog posts published
* At least 32 total contacts made with prospective employers
* At least two of your portfolio projects fully polished and deployed online,
  with complete and well-documented readmes

In addition to these, this first month is a good time to do some self-assessing.
Take some time to identify what technical topics you need improvement on. For
instance, are there any recurring topics or skills you should learn based on the
jobs you've applied for? If you've gone through any interviews, what sort of
feedback have you received?

Use these questions to help shape goals for your next milestone.

## Second Month

* Eight post-grad blog posts published (this means eight new topics you’ve
  learned about!)
* A minimum of 64 total contacts made with prospective employers
* At this point, three of your portfolio projects should be fully polished and
  deployed online, with demos recorded
* Your personal website is up and running
* You've worked through most of the Computer Science content in this track and
  have started completing code challenges consistently on a site like CodeWars

## Third Month

* 12 post-grad blog posts published (oh yea!)
* A minimum of 96 total contacts made with prospective employers
* You've completed many code challenges and are comfortable talking about some
  of the common code interview data structures like binary search trees and
  linked lists
* You've continued to advance your JavaScript skills by learning more about
  Node, Express, and have started building a new project using full-stack
  JavaScript

## Fourth Month

* 16 post-grad blog posts
* A minimum of 128 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've spent significant time practicing your interview skills and
  incorporating feedback from the interviews you've had so far. You are
  comfortable answering many of the most common interview questions
* You've finished and deployed your first post-graduate portfolio project
* You've started writing tests for your projects and are incorporating some into
  your existing portfolio projects

## Fifth Month

* 20 post-grad blog posts
* A minimum of 160 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've participated in a hackathon and have continued to improve your
  submission, turning it into an additional portfolio project
* You've worked your way through the first half of Eloquent JS
* You've greatly improved your knowledge of React and incorporated Hooks and
  Context into a project

## Sixth Month

With six months of continued learning, you'll have significantly improved your
skills compared to where you were at the beginning of this journey.

* 24 post-grad blog posts
* A minimum of 192 contacts made with prospective employers
* You've finished Eloquent JS
* Based on some of the jobs you've been interested in, you've started to learn
  TypeScript and have used it in your React projects

## Conclusion

Again, beyond the required tasks, your individual roadmap may not have the same
goals as those listed above. It will be shaped by your own self-assessments, the
types of jobs you're applying for, and topics that interest you the most.

The essential concept here is that you build your own structure. Don't keep it
all in your head. Use whatever tools work for you to establish an effective
routine and try to stick to it.  And leverage your Career Coach to help keep you
accountable.

The greatest challenge during this time isn't learning and improving skills.
You've already proven you can do that. The greatest challenge is developing the
habits you will need to continually work towards your goals.  In case you
haven’t heard this lately, you’re doing a great job.  Keep at it.
